        <h3>What Is The History Of The Anti Tiktok Union?</h3>
        <p> The Anti Tiktok union was founded by African Warlord#9456 (now Chris hansen#6589) on October 11th of 2021 with the co-owners being Sopex#6572, Doctor Carter#7926, and brah#5330, yes quite young. The Anti Tiktok's "Older Brother" is the Thot Police Department which was founded by brah#5330 sometime around 2018-2019w, the Anti Tiktok Union rose to power after the Thot Police Unfortunately fell due to irrelevance</p>

                <h3>Explaining The Dangers Of TikTok</h3>
                <p>By realMrPersonManE#0880 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZvXBDuyPEfj5fWhqMLwgfw"><img class="realMrPerson-youtube-logo" src="/images/youtube-logo.png" alt="YouTube logo"></a></p>

                <h4>Major security issues </h4>
                <p>Tik tok has been known to collect as much data as possible from users more than Google and Facebook does, which also records everything you say while your phone is off since it has an interface where tiktok picks the content that YOU like without you knowning and sends it in the FYP (For You Page), plus it also shares its information to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) which is the current government of China, which is known for banning anything from TikTok that mentions anything from Tibet Crackdowns to Uyghur Concentration camps. Tiktok has also been known to suppress users who for the algoritm looked "ugly" or disabled people</p>
    
                <h4>Terrible mental effects </h4>
                <p>With every social media, it is gonna have a lot of negative mental effects, so here are the terrible mental effects for TikTok. TikTok is so addictive to the point you will have a problem with your attention span and could cause some depression after being very addictive to the app since you question and ask why these people are popular but you aren't, and also causes psychological distress which also causes people to lose many social behaviors to the point that some girls developed tics.</p>
    
                <h4>Massive pedophilia problem</h4>
                <p>Since more and more young people join TikTok, the more people who love children start to creep up, one of the most infamous pedos of the site is TheBudday after he was found out grooming children while also sharing CP (Child Pornography). By the way it takes them forever to ban a pedophile on the site due to its terrible cyber safety and its complete laziness.</p>
                    
                <h4>Tiktok "challenges"</h4>
                <p>This is very well known by everyone that tiktok has the most dangerous and harmful challenges in existence, one example is the "blackout" challenge where kids hold their breaths until they become unresponsive to the point they actually die. Another example is the devious lick challenge where kids will be stealing stuff from school without permission and destroy public bathrooms. Another one is the "foreigner" challenge where the song Foreigner is played and where kids do sexual acts and content. There are alot more of these dangerous challenges, the most recent one being the nyquil chicken challenge, where you cook chicken in nyquil, a medicine for cold and flu. this has MANY bad physical and mental effects due to the high amount of drugs like: liver damage, vomiting, and maybe even death</p>
                    
                <h4>Overall Cringe Ngl</h4>
                <p>To be honest, this one is pretty very well obvious, any tiktok video you see there will be always cringe humor, unfunny memes/skits, unoriginal dances, boring facts and its just overall bad app, we do not recommend using it.</p>
